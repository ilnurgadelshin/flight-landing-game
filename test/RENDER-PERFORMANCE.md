# Renderer performance — 2026-09-28

Measured on Apple M2 Pro using Chromium 141.0.7390.37, ANGLE Metal, macOS arm64.
The GPU renderer string was checked; these are not SwiftShader results.

The baseline is pushed main `b707c85`. The followup adds close-ground detail, blended
camera-facing tree views, facade relief and feathered building shadows.

| Quality / scene | Baseline FPS | Followup FPS | Frame ms p50 / p95 | CPU submission ms p50 / p95 | Draw calls (median) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| High / captain | 31.9 | 31.5 | 33.3 / 33.4 | 3.8 / 7.6 | 940 |
| High / nearby | 41.4 | 40.5 | 16.7 / 33.4 | 2.9 / 6.4 | 408 |
| High / storm | 48.0 | 47.9 | 16.7 / 33.4 | 3.9 / 5.5 | 934 |
| Low / captain | 60.0 | 60.0 | 16.7 / 16.8 | 2.5 / 3.4 | 513 |
| Low / nearby | 60.0 | 60.0 | 16.7 / 16.7 | 2.2 / 4.6 | 270 |
| Low / storm | 60.0 | 60.0 | 16.7 / 16.7 | 2.9 / 4.6 | 491 |

Viewport: **1440 × 900 CSS pixels**. High uses the usual **1.5×** pixel ratio
(**2160 × 1350 render pixels**); low uses **1×**. Each scene warms for four seconds
and samples for twelve seconds. Scene, weather, planting seed and camera path match.
The near-ground camera moves through 30 m, exercising scenery selection and tree fades.
High uses world MSAA/bloom and the detailed cockpit; low uses its normal cheaper assets.

These measurements show broadly similar performance to the baseline, not a demonstrated
speedup. The high tier is around 31–48 FPS at this render scale; low is display-capped near
60 FPS. A preliminary corrected 1× baseline was around 59–60 FPS on high, showing the
substantial cost of the extra rendered pixels. Do not compare those numbers as a code improvement.

Limits: this is a private headless Chromium renderer benchmark with flight physics paused;
world updates, LOD selection and rendering still run. It does not measure a complete live
landing, another browser, mobile hardware, loading time or battery use. RAF cadence is
capped near 60 Hz. CPU submission time excludes asynchronous GPU work; frame pacing
includes it. Short runs and OS/GPU scheduling introduce variation. No frame-time assertion
is used as a portable pass/fail test.

Run without other graphics tests or heavy applications competing for the GPU:

```sh
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/path/to/chromium-cache node test/render-benchmark.mjs current
```

The script currently targets macOS Metal and refuses unverified/software renderer strings.
`BENCHMARK_DPR=1` changes high-quality pixel ratio explicitly; low always stays at 1.
`BENCHMARK_ROOT=/path/to/committed/snapshot` serves a baseline without modifying the working
checkout. Results are written to `test/output/render-benchmark-<label>.json`.

The retained before/after JSON reports are copied into `test/benchmarks/` for inspection.
An initial setup that failed to restore the cockpit camera and used its local position
for ground streaming was rejected and rerun before this comparison.

## Cockpit lighting and surveyed terrain — 2026-09-30

Baseline: committed main `e66583b`. Followup: scanned cockpit finishes, cached cabin
reflections/window illumination and registered USGS terrain. Both versions were measured
on the same Apple M2 Pro, Chromium 141.0.7390.37 and ANGLE Metal, with the resolution,
camera paths and sampling method described above. Runs were sequential, without other
graphics tests competing for the GPU. Reports: `benchmarks/2026-09-30-before.json` and
`benchmarks/2026-09-30-after.json`.

| Quality / scene | Baseline FPS | Followup FPS | Frame ms p50 / p95 | CPU submission ms p50 / p95 | Draw calls (median) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| High / captain | 30.1 | 28.5 | 33.3 / 50.0 | 4.4 / 9.1 | 940 |
| High / nearby | 37.7 | 36.1 | 33.3 / 33.4 | 2.9 / 5.9 | 408 |
| High / storm | 46.3 | 44.5 | 16.7 / 33.4 | 4.0 / 5.5 | 934 |
| Low / captain | 60.0 | 60.0 | 16.7 / 16.7 | 2.6 / 3.5 | 513 |
| Low / nearby | 60.0 | 60.0 | 16.7 / 16.7 | 2.0 / 3.9 | 270 |
| Low / storm | 60.0 | 60.0 | 16.7 / 16.7 | 2.5 / 3.6 | 491 |

High average FPS decreased approximately 4–5%; the captain scene's p95 frame time
increased from 33.5 to 50.0 ms. Low remained at the 60 Hz display ceiling. This is a
quality/performance tradeoff, not a speedup. Draw calls are unchanged; terrain skirts add
about 15–18 thousand rendered triangles in high scenes. An initial implementation that
evaluated two area lights per pixel every frame was substantially slower and was replaced
by cached diffuse window illumination plus area-lit reflection captures before this run.

These short steady-state runs do not measure the initial cabin capture, scenario-switch
stalls, full-flight physics, other GPUs or mobile devices. The earlier benchmark's limits
still apply; the 2026-09-28 and 2026-09-30 numbers should not be treated as a controlled
comparison with each other.
